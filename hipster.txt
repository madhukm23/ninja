We all know that true code implementation is one of the most important success factors for the success of any cryptocurrency project. This project can only be called a successful project if the great vision is implemented and deployed through code.

I have been keeping a constant eye on iota's code contributions on github. I have also been following its ranking in the code section on https://messari.io/onchainfx. Two months ago, its "Commits, last 90 days" and "Lines Added, last 90 days" indicators were ranked in the top five, but now, the two indicators have ranked below the top 30.

Of course, I know that the priority of coding in each development phase will be different, and the programming style of different programmers will also affect this data. But the decline in these rankings really makes me feel very worried. I don't want other factors to make a negative influence on programmers, such as the recent frequent drama.

I hope that my worries are superfluous. What do you think?
